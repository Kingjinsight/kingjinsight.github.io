This week, I browsed many old machines at ebay to use for my first attempt at setting up a homelab. Initially, I planned to build a machine myself during the summer holiday, but in today I found a great performance and a high cost-effective machine that changed my mind.
# Overview
The machine model is `HP-Elitedesk-800-G4-SFF`. Compared to its previous generation, the chipset supports 8th and 9th generation of intel core cpu, which offers a significant improvement(6c6t) compare with 6th/7th core cpu(4c4t). Furthermore it provides NVme express in this generation. With these components, I can build a highly cost-effective homelab. The total cost is Â£150.

# Hardware
- Motherboard: Q370
  - [viewer](/server_motherboard.pdf)
- CPU: i5-8500
- GPU: intel UHD 630
- RAM: 16G
- SSD:  256G
- HDD: 500G * 1

The motherboard provides a high flexibility to expand more internal storage, also it has 4 PCie expansion slots which can used to expand more storage space or other components you want.
