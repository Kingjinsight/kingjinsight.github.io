## Trivias:
1. Generating functions are a powerful mathematical tool that transform discrete sequences into algebraic functions, enabling us to solve complex combinatorial counting problems through function operations.
2. GPOS vs RTOS
   1. General purpose operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux are designed to provide a versatile, user-friendly computing environment. They prioritize overall system efficiency, with more flexible restrictions on task response times.
   2. Real time operating systems such as VxWorks, focus on strict time limitations for individual tasks, ensuring predictable and deterministic responses. These systems are typically used in environments demanding high reliability and precise time control, featuring a smaller, more streamlined kernel that guarantees real-time performance.
