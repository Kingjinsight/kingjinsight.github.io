> An AI-powered English learning application built on Electron. The app's core function is a dictionary, which records each word you searched. The search history is then used to generate a unique review story, allowing you to practice new vocabulary in conversational contexts rather than just through translation.

## Motivation
I dislike the traditional method of using a dictionary to search a word, gettings its translation and storing it in a new word notebook. This relies on rote memorization, but using a word is the most efficient way to remember it. Therefore, a fter a day's record, a user can generate a short conversational story with an LLM to help recall the meaning of each new word, which should make a stronger impression.

## Tech stack
Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, Electron, Javascript

## Roadmap
Future: support multi-language data record system

## Summary
This project takes me one week to build. To be honest, Electron is convenient for cross platform, but also it increase the size of the software.
