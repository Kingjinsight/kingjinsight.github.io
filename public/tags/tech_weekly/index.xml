&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Graph&lt;/code&gt; is a great data structure, it can be used to find the shortest path, solve a magic cube.
Rely on this data structure, Human find the shortest steps to solve the worst case configured
&lt;code&gt;3\*3\*3&lt;/code&gt; magic cube in &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; steps (which also called god&amp;rsquo;s number) and 11 steps for &lt;code&gt;2\*2\*2&lt;/code&gt; one. What about n*n*n, Here is an interesing paper
about time compleixity of solving a n*n*n magic cube: &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/Demaine_Algoritms_for_solving.pdf&#34;&gt;Algorithms for Solving Rubik’s Cubes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topological sort is an algorithm based on DFS and DAG, It&amp;rsquo;s not a traditional sorting algorithm, like comparing the size of each number and sort them, but sorting based on dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic programming is just like recursion + memorization + guessing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P vs NP problems: P is a problem  that can be solved easily by a computer, NP is a problem that you can check for correctness very easily once solved. However, P != NP for example wec can&amp;rsquo;t engineer luck.
Also, NP hard means it is at least as hard as any problem in NP, and NP-complete is lke if you can solve one NP-complete question, you can solve all NP question.
Reduction is like to prove a known NP-complete question, and transfer it into a NP question X, then X is also a NP-complete question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MCP(Model context protocol) can be understand as a uniform langauge between LLM and external services. Just like a translator, to let different AI application(llm, cursor) and different tools(github, calendar) to talk easily, rather than develop a new API between them. In the past, every time you want an AI assistant to interact with a new tool, you would need to develop a separate interface for each tool. This led to a huge amount of work because you&amp;rsquo;re have to create multiple integrations. MCP simplifies this by ensuring that all AI applications only need to support MCp, and all tools only need to support MCP, allowing them to communicate with each other easily  and reducing development cost.

&lt;p&gt;SMTP is used for sending emails to the recipient’s email server, but it does not handle receiving emails.
User1 sends an email via an email client, and the email is first sent to User1&amp;rsquo;s email server using SMTP. Then, the email server forwards it to the recipient&amp;rsquo;s email server using SMTP as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="email-sending-and-receiving-system">Email sending and receiving system</h2>
<p>The main system is build based on three protocols: SMTP, POP3 and IMAP.
<img alt="process of email system" loading="lazy" src="/emailsys.png"></p>
<p>SMTP is used for sending emails to the recipient’s email server, but it does not handle receiving emails.
User1 sends an email via an email client, and the email is first sent to User1&rsquo;s email server using SMTP. Then, the email server forwards it to the recipient&rsquo;s email server using SMTP as well.</p>
<p>POP3 downloads emails from the email server to the email client. By default, it removes emails from the server after downloading, but some email clients allow users to keep copies on the server.
IMAP keeps emails on the server and synchronizes them across multiple devices. The email client initially loads only the headers, and the full email content is fetched from the server when the user opens it.</p>
<p>If you want to customize an email domain. You need to have your own SMTP and IMAP/POP3 server and a domain, the other steps are the same as above.</p>
<h2 id="pkgbuild-in-arch-linux">PKGBUILD in Arch Linux</h2>
<p>PKGBUILD is a bash script contain the build information required by archlinux package
we use makepkg script to build the package, it will search PKGBUILD first in the current folder.
<img alt="PKGBUILD process" loading="lazy" src="/Hand_write_note/pkgbuild.jpg">
Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>using pacman to manage, user can update and uninstall easily</li>
<li>some pkgbuild file include the commands to generate a binary file and store it in /user/bin</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not friendly to starter</li>
</ul>

<li>Newton&rsquo;s method is quadratic convergence when we want to calculate the root of a number</li>
<li>Catalan number is a group of sequence that appear widely in combinatorics. e.g. ways to arrange n brackets, number of triangles in an n+2 convex polygon. The common property of these applications is that they are recursive and have a constrained structure.</li>
<li>Toom cook: It divide a d-digit number into n parts and doing arithmatic calculations.</li>
<li>Schonhage-strassen scheme: It multiplies two integers of length 𝑛 in O (𝑛 log𝑛 log log𝑛) steps on a multitape Turing machine</li>
<li>A Naive algorithm is usually the most obvious solution when one is asked a problem. It may not be a smart algorithm but will probably get the job done</li>
<li>The taste of red wine is determined by acidity, sweetness, alcohol content, tannins, and body. Wines are categorized into New World and Old World. New World wines (from countries like the USA, Chile, Argentina, and China) are named after the grape variety, while Old World wines (mainly from Europe) are named after their place of origin.<br>
Red wine is made by fermenting red grapes with their skins. White wine is made from either white grapes or red grapes without their skins. Rosé wine is made by soaking the grape skins briefly but fermenting without them. Sparkling wine undergoes a second fermentation to produce bubbles.</li>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>If no one is reading blogs anymore, why should we write them?
Let’s make it simple: you write a blog, but nobody cares, nobody reads it.
At least, the number of readers is not as many as you thought.
You put your personal ideas and thoughts into the article, carefully structuring each sentence, and choose a great image—then, no response, no likes, no shares, no activity.
So, what is the meaning of writing a blog?
First, there are two misconceptions about blogging.
One is that if I write a good article, readers will come naturally.
No, they won’t come. There are billions of blogs on the internet, like a massive hurricane, and yours is just a single leaf in the wind. Who would notice?
Another misconception is that if nobody reads it, writing is a waste of time.
Blogs have their own hidden value.
You write blogs not for the applause of others, but for your own needs.
Blogs help clear your mind. They help you organize your thoughts and sharpen your perspective.
When you think better, you will achieve better results.
The target audience of a blog is actually not the people on the internet, but your future self. Your article will help you see the evolution of your own thoughts.
Additionally, one day in the future, someone who truly needs your article will find it.
A deep, thoughtful article has a longer-lasting impact than a viral article.
Writing a blog is quite like street photography. You take your camera and walk through the city.
You see a scene—a moment filled with light, shadow, and humanity—and then you capture it.
Nobody cares about what you actually captured. But that’s not the reason you photograph; you photograph because you see something interesting.
Writing a blog is the same. You write a blog because you are thinking, observing new things, and hope to store them somewhere.
If someone reads it, that&rsquo;s great. If not, you’ve still completed your work</p>
