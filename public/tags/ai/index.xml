      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bitcoin&#34;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legend of Bitcoin has shown its magic for a long time. Recently, I have started to explore this field, and this is a record of my learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-blockchain&#34;&gt;The Blockchain‚õìÔ∏è&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;blockchain&lt;/strong&gt; is the foundational technology of Bitcoin. Think of it as a public, digital ledger or receipt book that is shared across thousands of computers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Chain of Blocks:&lt;/strong&gt; Each &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; contains a list of recent transactions. When a new block is created, it is cryptographically linked to the previous one, forming an unbroken chain leading all the way back to the very first block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Immutable:&lt;/strong&gt; Because each block is linked to the one before it, changing a transaction in an old block would require re-doing all the work for every single block that came after it. This makes the ledger permanent and tamper-proof. This structure is what proves each coin&amp;rsquo;s history and prevents fraud like double-spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-genesis-block&#34;&gt;The Genesis Blocküìú&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first block, known as the &lt;strong&gt;Genesis Block&lt;/strong&gt;, was mined on &lt;strong&gt;2009.01.04&lt;/strong&gt;, by Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s mysterious creator, &lt;strong&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto&lt;/strong&gt;. This single block was the start of the entire Bitcoin network. Once it was created, the race to mine the second block began, and the chain has been growing continuously ever since.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The legend of Bitcoin has shown its magic for a long time. Recently, I have started to explore this field, and this is a record of my learning.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-blockchain">The Blockchain‚õìÔ∏è</h4>
<p>The <strong>blockchain</strong> is the foundational technology of Bitcoin. Think of it as a public, digital ledger or receipt book that is shared across thousands of computers worldwide.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s a Chain of Blocks:</strong> Each &ldquo;block&rdquo; contains a list of recent transactions. When a new block is created, it is cryptographically linked to the previous one, forming an unbroken chain leading all the way back to the very first block.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s Immutable:</strong> Because each block is linked to the one before it, changing a transaction in an old block would require re-doing all the work for every single block that came after it. This makes the ledger permanent and tamper-proof. This structure is what proves each coin&rsquo;s history and prevents fraud like double-spending.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-genesis-block">The Genesis Blocküìú</h4>
<p>The very first block, known as the <strong>Genesis Block</strong>, was mined on <strong>2009.01.04</strong>, by Bitcoin&rsquo;s mysterious creator, <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>. This single block was the start of the entire Bitcoin network. Once it was created, the race to mine the second block began, and the chain has been growing continuously ever since.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="mining">Mining‚õèÔ∏è</h4>
<p>Mining is the process of creating new blocks. It&rsquo;s a competitive race that serves two critical purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Validating Transactions:</strong> Miners group pending transactions into a new block.</li>
<li><strong>Creating New Bitcoin:</strong> The winner of the race is rewarded with new bitcoin.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here‚Äôs how a miner wins the race and proves their block is valid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Hashing Puzzle:</strong> Miners take the data in their block and use their computers to find a specific number called a <strong>nonce</strong>. When the block data and the nonce are combined and put through a cryptographic function (SHA-256), they produce a unique digital fingerprint called a <strong>hash</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Lower Than&rdquo; Rule:</strong> To win, a miner must find a hash that is <strong>lower than the current network &ldquo;target&rdquo;</strong>. This target is a very large number that the entire network agrees on. Finding a hash below this target is incredibly difficult and requires immense computational power‚Äîit&rsquo;s like trying to win a global lottery every 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>The Reward and The Halving:</strong> The first miner to find a valid hash wins the <strong>block reward</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Initially, the reward was <strong>50 BTC</strong>.</li>
<li>However, this reward is programmed to cut in half roughly every four years (or 210,000 blocks) in an event called the <strong>halving</strong>.</li>
<li>As of the April 2024 halving, the reward is now <strong>3.125 BTC</strong>.</li>
<li>This mechanism controls the supply of new bitcoin, making the currency scarce and ensuring its total amount will never exceed <strong>21 million coins</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a winning block is found, its hash is broadcast across the P2P network. All other participants quickly verify that the hash is valid. Once confirmed, they add the new block to their copy of the blockchain and immediately start competing to solve the <em>next</em> block.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="how-to-mine">How to Mine:</h4>
<p>There are a few ways to participate in Bitcoin mining, each with its own pros and cons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solo Mining:</strong> This is you, on your own, trying to solve a block. If you succeed, you get the <em>entire</em> block reward (3.125 BTC + transaction fees). However, the odds of a single person solving a block today are astronomically low due to the immense competition. It&rsquo;s like buying a single lottery ticket and hoping to win the grand prize.</li>
<li><strong>Mining Pool:</strong> This is the most common method. You join a &ldquo;pool&rdquo; with thousands of other miners, combining your computing power. The pool works together to find blocks much more frequently. When the pool wins, the reward is split among all participants based on how much computing power they contributed. This provides smaller, but much more consistent and predictable, payouts.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="block-forks">Block Forksüç¥</h4>
<p>A <strong>fork</strong> happens when the blockchain temporarily or permanently splits into two different paths.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accidental Fork:</strong> Sometimes, two miners find a valid block at almost the exact same time. The network briefly splits as some nodes follow one miner and some follow the other. This is usually resolved within a few minutes when the next block is found and added to one of the chains, making it the &ldquo;longest&rdquo; and therefore the official one. The shorter chain is then abandoned.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Fork:</strong> This is an intentional split that happens when the network&rsquo;s software rules are changed in a way that is not backward-compatible. All participants must upgrade to the new rules to continue. If a significant portion of the community refuses to upgrade, the split becomes permanent, resulting in the creation of a new, separate cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin Cash was created from a hard fork of Bitcoin).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="ethics">Ethics</h4>
<p>Mining bitcoin always consume immense energy, which critics view as a wasteful environmental cost for a seemingly meaningless computation. Proponents argue this mechanism decentralized financial system that offers freedom from the control of banks and governments.</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scott_Sherrington">Sherrington</a>, coined the word &ldquo;synapse&rdquo; to define the connection between two neurons</li>
<li>Two different roads of AI: connectionism and Symbolism.</li>
<li>Hidden layer was firstly been implemented in Boltzmann machine, although Rosenblatt had some idea about multilayer perceptrons, but he didn&rsquo;t find any useful training algorithm.</li>
<li>Restricted Boltzmann machine - each layer is only allowed to be fully connectted to the next layer, current layer nodes are not connectted to each other. The advantages of this machine is it allows to update bodes within the same layer in parallel</li>
<li>The invention of hidden layer allows model to understand abstract features. It also becomes to one of the most significant component in deep learning.</li>
<li>The main difference between the Hopfield Network and the Boltzmann nachine is the presence of hidden layers. Other differences include the fact that the Hopfield network is deterministic, whereas the Boltzmann machine is stochastic, and the defintions of their energy function also differ.</li>
<li>The fovea has many photoreceptors, with a high density of cones(for colors) and nearly no rods(for dark). This structure allows us to see the world clearly. If you develop myopia, the image formed after light is reflected by the eye may not be focused directly on the fovea.</li>
<li>The idea of CNN was mainly inspired by the HMAX model(hierarchical, pooling, convolution), and the HMAX model was proposed by Tomaso Poggio, to simulate primate visual system, specifically ventral stream.</li>
<li>Pytorch for research area, Tensorflow for industry and JAX for high level usage.</li>
<li>Ethereum and ether is not the same as bitcoin. Ethereum has a longer vision, and the number of ether is unlimited.</li>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2024 Nobel Physics prize was earned by Professor John Hopfield and Professor Geoffrey Hinton, to thanks their distribution on machine learning.
However, I felt very suprised that why it gives to machine learning? Anyway, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t deeply find the answer in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Professor Geoffrey Hinton gived us a short lecture about Boltzmann machine virtually.
And before the lecture, I learned Hopfield Network(the predecessor of Boltzimann machine) at my accommodation.
So today I will record this moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, I felt very suprised that why it gives to machine learning? Anyway, I hadn&rsquo;t deeply find the answer in that time.</p>
<p>Recently, Professor Geoffrey Hinton gived us a short lecture about Boltzmann machine virtually.
And before the lecture, I learned Hopfield Network(the predecessor of Boltzimann machine) at my accommodation.
So today I will record this moment.</p>
<p>Hopfield Network was invented at 1982. Processor John Hopfield designed it based on ideas from statistical mechanics.</p>
<p><img alt="metaphor" loading="lazy" src="/Hand_write_note/hopfield_network_metaphor.png">
The graph above shows two states of a ball
From the left part, we can see the energy system of the ball is at the highest, which means the ball is very unstable
From the right part, we can see the ball had already fall into the bottom, which means the ball is very stable.
Although it is a classical physics model, but it definitly explain the main idea of hopfield network.</p>
<p>So now we can say hopfield network is just make a system move from an unstable state to stable state.</p>
<p>If you interested how exactly hopfield network work. See the video below, it&rsquo;s pretty nice.</p>

frameborder="0" 
allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>This idea is also useful in today.
In LLM, we can say the user&rsquo;s prompt and question is the most unstable states while the answer is the stable state.</p>
<p>Based on the concept of Hopfield networks, many different architectures had been invented, which makes Connectionism and Deep Learning great again.</p>
<p>After all, I catch the reason why nobel prize gives to physics.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;model-context-protocol-overview&#34;&gt;Model Context Protocol overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCP (Model Context Protocol) can be understood as a &amp;ldquo;universal language&amp;rdquo; for communication between AI and external tools. It&amp;rsquo;s like a translator, allowing different AI applications (such as chatbots, code assistants) and different tools (like databases, GitHub, calendars) to easily communicate without needing to develop a new interface every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-is-mcp-needed&#34;&gt;Why is MCP needed?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, if you wanted an AI assistant to access different tools, like a calendar, email, or task manager, you would need to develop a separate interface for each tool (function calling), which resulted in a huge amount of work (N AI applications √ó M tools = N√óM interfaces).&lt;br&gt;
MCP simplifies everything: all AI applications only need to support MCP, and all tools only need to support MCP. This way, they can communicate with each other, reducing development costs (N+M interfaces).

<h4 id="why-is-mcp-needed">Why is MCP needed?</h4>
<p>In the past, if you wanted an AI assistant to access different tools, like a calendar, email, or task manager, you would need to develop a separate interface for each tool (function calling), which resulted in a huge amount of work (N AI applications √ó M tools = N√óM interfaces).<br>

<h4 id="how-does-mcp-work">How does MCP work?</h4>
<p><img alt="how mcp work" loading="lazy" src="/TechStuff/mcp_work.png"></p>
<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re using an AI assistant to manage your work, and it wants to help you schedule today&rsquo;s meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Without MCP, developers would need to write separate integration code for Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With MCP, the AI only needs to call the MCP server, which will automatically interface with your calendar system. No matter which calendar service you use, the AI can work seamlessly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="core-functions-of-mcp">Core Functions of MCP:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reducing development costs (no need to develop separate integrations for each tool).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing AI&rsquo;s ability to access external data (allowing AI to easily query and manipulate external data).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardizing communication (making communication between different AI applications and tools smoother).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of MCP as the &ldquo;USB interface for AI&rdquo;‚Äîany AI device can plug into different tools without needing to individually adapt to each one!</p>

<li><code>Graph</code> is a great data structure, it can be used to find the shortest path, solve a magic cube.
Rely on this data structure, Human find the shortest steps to solve the worst case configured
<code>3\*3\*3</code> magic cube in <strong>20</strong> steps (which also called god&rsquo;s number) and 11 steps for <code>2\*2\*2</code> one. What about n*n*n, Here is an interesing paper
about time compleixity of solving a n*n*n magic cube: <a href="/Demaine_Algoritms_for_solving.pdf">Algorithms for Solving Rubik‚Äôs Cubes</a></li>
<li>Topological sort is an algorithm based on DFS and DAG, It&rsquo;s not a traditional sorting algorithm, like comparing the size of each number and sort them, but sorting based on dependencies.</li>
<li>Dynamic programming is just like recursion + memorization + guessing</li>
<li>P vs NP problems: P is a problem  that can be solved easily by a computer, NP is a problem that you can check for correctness very easily once solved. However, P != NP for example wec can&rsquo;t engineer luck.
Also, NP hard means it is at least as hard as any problem in NP, and NP-complete is lke if you can solve one NP-complete question, you can solve all NP question.
Reduction is like to prove a known NP-complete question, and transfer it into a NP question X, then X is also a NP-complete question</li>
<li>HTTP vs REST API
<ul>
<li>
<p>HTTP is a protocol, and its core task is to define how to request and transfer data between your broswer and server</p>
<ul>
<li>It focuses on the data exchange level, regardless of whether the data is an image, text, video, or API response.</li>
<li>For example, you can use an HTTP request to access a webpage (HTML page) or use an HTTP request to retrieve API data (JSON data). It doesn‚Äôt care about what data you&rsquo;re transmitting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST API is a design style, based on the HTTP protocol, with rules and best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>It views content on the server as &ldquo;resources&rdquo; and specifies how to operate on them using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</li>
<li>REST API design considers resource orientation: Resources (like users, articles, comments, etc.) have unique identifiers (URIs), and clients interact with these resources through HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in a REST API, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>GET request: Retrieve a resource (e.g., get movie information).</li>
<li>POST request: Create a new resource (e.g., submit a new comment).</li>
<li>PUT request: Update a resource (e.g., modify user information).</li>
<li>DELETE request: Delete a resource (e.g., remove an article).</li>
</ul>
