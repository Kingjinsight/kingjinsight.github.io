It\u0026rsquo;s like a translator, allowing different AI applications (such as chatbots, code assistants) and different tools (like databases, GitHub, calendars) to easily communicate without needing to develop a new interface every time.\nWhy is MCP needed? In the past, if you wanted an AI assistant to access different tools, like a calendar, email, or task manager, you would need to develop a separate interface for each tool (function calling), which resulted in a huge amount of work (N AI applications √ó M tools = N√óM interfaces).\nMCP simplifies everything: all AI applications only need to support MCP, and all tools only need to support MCP. This way, they can communicate with each other, reducing development costs (N+M interfaces). The current components of MCP servers include: How does MCP work? Example: Suppose you\u0026rsquo;re using an AI assistant to manage your work, and it wants to help you schedule today\u0026rsquo;s meeting:\nWithout MCP, developers would need to write separate integration code for Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar.\nWith MCP, the AI only needs to call the MCP server, which will automatically interface with your calendar system. No matter which calendar service you use, the AI can work seamlessly.\nCore Functions of MCP: Reducing development costs (no need to develop separate integrations for each tool).\nEnhancing AI\u0026rsquo;s ability to access external data (allowing AI to easily query and manipulate external data).\nStandardizing communication (making communication between different AI applications and tools smoother).\nYou can think of MCP as the \u0026ldquo;USB interface for AI\u0026rdquo;‚Äîany AI device can plug into different tools without needing to individually adapt to each one!\nTrivias: Graph is a great data structure, it can be used to find the shortest path, solve a magic cube. Rely on this data structure, Human find the shortest steps to solve the worst case configured 3\\*3\\*3 magic cube in 20 steps (which also called god\u0026rsquo;s number) and 11 steps for 2\\*2\\*2 one.

Dynamic programming is just like recursion + memorization + guessing P vs NP problems: P is a problem that can be solved easily by a computer, NP is a problem that you can check for correctness very easily once solved. However, P != NP for example wec can\u0026rsquo;t engineer luck. Also, NP hard means it is at least as hard as any problem in NP, and NP-complete is lke if you can solve one NP-complete question, you can solve all NP question. Reduction is like to prove a known NP-complete question, and transfer it into a NP question X, then X is also a NP-complete question HTTP vs REST API HTTP is a protocol, and its core task is to define how to request and transfer data between your broswer and server\nIt focuses on the data exchange level, regardless of whether the data is an image, text, video, or API response. For example, you can use an HTTP request to access a webpage (HTML page) or use an HTTP request to retrieve API data (JSON data). It doesn‚Äôt care about what data you\u0026rsquo;re transmitting. REST API is a design style, based on the HTTP protocol, with rules and best practices:\nIt views content on the server as \u0026ldquo;resources\u0026rdquo; and specifies how to operate on them using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). REST API design considers resource orientation: Resources (like users, articles, comments, etc.) have unique identifiers (URIs), and clients interact with these resources through HTTP requests. For example, in a REST API, you can:\nGET request: Retrieve a resource (e.g., get movie information). POST request: Create a new resource (e.g., submit a new comment). PUT request: Update a resource (e.g., modify user information). DELETE request: Delete a resource (e.g., remove an article).

SMTP is used for sending emails to the recipient‚Äôs email server, but it does not handle receiving emails. User1 sends an email via an email client, and the email is first sent to User1\u0026rsquo;s email server using SMTP. Then, the email server forwards it to the recipient\u0026rsquo;s email server using SMTP as well.\nPOP3 downloads emails from the email server to the email client. By default, it removes emails from the server after downloading, but some email clients allow users to keep copies on the server. IMAP keeps emails on the server and synchronizes them across multiple devices. The email client initially loads only the headers, and the full email content is fetched from the server when the user opens it.\nIf you want to customize an email domain.

Let‚Äôs make it simple: you write a blog, but nobody cares, nobody reads it. At least, the number of readers is not as many as you thought. You put your personal ideas and thoughts into the article, carefully structuring each sentence, and choose a great image‚Äîthen, no response, no likes, no shares, no activity. So, what is the meaning of writing a blog? First, there are two misconceptions about blogging. One is that if I write a good article, readers will come naturally. No, they won‚Äôt come. There are billions of blogs on the internet, like a massive hurricane, and yours is just a single leaf in the wind. Who would notice? Another misconception is that if nobody reads it, writing is a waste of time. Blogs have their own hidden value. You write blogs not for the applause of others, but for your own needs. Blogs help clear your mind. They help you organize your thoughts and sharpen your perspective. When you think better, you will achieve better results. The target audience of a blog is actually not the people on the internet, but your future self. Your article will help you see the evolution of your own thoughts. Additionally, one day in the future, someone who truly needs your article will find it. A deep, thoughtful article has a longer-lasting impact than a viral article. Writing a blog is quite like street photography. You take your camera and walk through the city. You see a scene‚Äîa moment filled with light, shadow, and humanity‚Äîand then you capture it. Nobody cares about what you actually captured. But that‚Äôs not the reason you photograph; you photograph because you see something interesting. Writing a blog is the same. You write a blog because you are thinking, observing new things, and hope to store them somewhere. If someone reads it, that\u0026rsquo;s great.

What fascinates me the most is why Java has the JVM. I learned Python, C++, js and Haskell before, but all of them doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a jargon for virtual machine. And then I went to wikipeidia to find out why.\nIn 1995, Sun Microsystems introduced Java and the JVM to the world with an ambitious dream: \u0026ldquo;Write Once, Run Anywhere.\u0026rdquo; This WORA philosophy became a reality through the JVM, enabling Java applications to run on any operating system with a compatible JVM. Before talking about the archivements and limitations, Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look about how JVM works.\nHow the JVM works The JVM executes er programs in several stages:\nCompilation: Java source code (.java) is compiled into bytecode (.class) by the Java Compiler (javac).\nClass Loading: The JVM loads compiled bytecode when required.\nBytecode Verification: Ensures security and correctness before execution.\nExecution: The JVM interprets or compiles bytecode using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.\nGarbage Collection: The JVM automatically manages memory, reclaiming unused objects.\nClass loader One of the organizational units of JVM byte code is a class. A class loader implementation must be able to recognize and load anything that conforms to the Java class file format. Any implementation is free to recognize other binary forms besides class files, but it must recognize class files.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s explore this concept with an example: Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re watching a movie on a streaming service.\nLoading:\nThe service first finds and imports the movie data you want to watch. Similarly, the class loader locates the binary data for a Java class. Linking: Verification: Before you watch the movie, the service checks that the file isn\u0026rsquo;t corrupted. In Java, the class loader verifies the correctness of the class. Preparation: The service sets up the necessary space in memory to buffer the movie. Java allocates memory for variables and sets default values. Resolution: The service ensures all necessary subtitles or audio tracks are ready to play. Java resolves references to make them direct. Initialization:\nAs you start watching, the service begins playing the movie. Similarly, Java runs code to set up variables with their starting values. Class Loader Types:\nBootstrap Class Loader: Like the service\u0026rsquo;s core library of well-known movies, it loads fundamental, trusted classes. Extension Class Loader: Similar to special add-on features, it loads additional classes outside the core library. System/Application Class Loader: Like searching for new releases or user-uploaded content, it loads classes specific to the application you‚Äôre using. Virtual machine architecture Cross-Platform Compatibility and Limitations The JVM abstracts away the underlying hardware and operating system specifics, allowing Java bytecode to run on any device equipped with a compatible JVM. This cross-platform capability greatly simplified software distribution and development, as developers could write code once and deploy it across various platforms without modification.\nDespite its strong cross-platform capabilities, the JVM faced significant challenges due to competitive corporate strategies, particularly the \u0026ldquo;Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish\u0026rdquo; (EEE) approach adopted by some companies like Microsoft in the late 1990s. This strategy involved embracing a technology, extending it with proprietary features, and eventually using those extensions to undermine the original technology.\nMicrosoft initially embraced Java by integrating it into their Internet Explorer browser and Windows platforms. However, they extended Java with proprietary features that were specific to Windows, creating a version of Java that was incompatible with the standard JVM specifications set by Sun Microsystems. This move fragmented the Java platform and undermined the \u0026ldquo;Write Once, Run Anywhere\u0026rdquo; philosophy.\nWith the development and rise of programming languages like Swift, Kotlin, and JavaScript, the JVM faced significant challenges in maintaining its performance edge. Swift, designed by Apple for iOS and macOS platforms, offers high performance and safety due to its compiled nature and modern language features. Kotlin, although initially running on the JVM, introduced concise syntax and advanced features that surpassed Java in many ways, leading it to become the preferred language for Android development. JavaScript\u0026rsquo;s performance greatly improved with engines like V8, and its versatility expanded through technologies like Node.js for server-side development. These languages not only matched but often exceeded the JVM\u0026rsquo;s performance and adaptability in their respective domains, leading to a shift in developer preferences and a relative decline in the JVM\u0026rsquo;s dominance.\nOverall Nowadays, Java has become to a normal programming lauguage. And the question is obvious solved. Python has its own interpreter to transfer the source code into machine code. Haskell has its own compiler, C++/C are compiled directly into machine code. However,they can\u0026rsquo;t generate a compiled file that enable to run in every operating system. If there is no EEE strategy, Linux may have a stronger effects in today\u0026rsquo;s world.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/jvm/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis semester, I learned OOP from Inf1B, which using java as the official teaching language.
